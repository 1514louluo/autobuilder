	aim ->just for convenient, little learning costs.
	new features:
	1. support build .so and .a!
	2. support ccache
	3. support multiple-tasks compile at the same time.

operate sequence:
	first of all. you must put your all src-files in "src" dir which is in program root dir.
		/xx/xx/PROGRAM_ROOT/src: here put your all src-files!!!
	1. move all dir in autobuilder to your program root dir, command just like:
	   	mv autobuilder/*  /XXXX/XXXX/PROGRAM_ROOT
	2. modify 'makefile.conf' in 'build' dir, add your own define, such as -I/dir or -llib...and so no!

	   	./configure --help    or      ./configure -h
	4. make	
	5. make install
	6. make clean
	7. make distclean
